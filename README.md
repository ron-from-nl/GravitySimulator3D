GravitySimulator3D allows you to simulate (anti) gravity on 3D objects by editing scene files

It all starts with:

MainStage -> LoadScene (extends SuperScene) -> Node3D (MyCam, MySphere, MyThis, MyThat, bla, bla).

You'll find the additional libraries in the libs dir. Don't forget to read up on the JavaFX 8 3D chapter.

This software was developed with: JDK 8u91 with NetBeans 8.1 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html
