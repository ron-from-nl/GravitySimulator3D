Gautama Buddha (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Gautama Buddha, also known as Siddhārtha Gautama,[note 3] Shakyamuni, 
or simply the Buddha, was a sage[3] on whose teachings Buddhism was founded.
He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in eastern India sometime 
between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE.[4][note 5]

The word Buddha means "awakened one" or "the enlightened one". 
"Buddha" is also used as a title for the first awakened being in an era.
In most Buddhist traditions, Siddhartha Gautama is regarded as the 
Supreme Buddha (Pali sammāsambuddha, Sanskrit samyaksaṃbuddha) of our age.
Gautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism
found in the Sramana (renunciation) movement[5] common in his region. 
He later taught throughout regions of eastern India such as Magadha and Kośala.

Gautama is the primary figure in Buddhism and accounts of his life, discourses, 
and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his 
death and memorized by his followers. 
Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by oral 
tradition and first committed to writing about 400 years later.

Historical Siddhārtha Gautama

Ancient kingdoms and cities of India during the time of Buddha.
Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of 
the Buddha's life. 
Most accept that he lived, taught and founded a monastic order during the 
Mahajanapada era in India during the reign of Bimbisara, the ruler of the 
Magadha empire, and died during the early years of the
reign of Ajatshatru who was the successor of Bimbisara, thus making him 
a younger contemporary of Mahavira, the Jain teacher.[7] 
Apart from the Vedic Brahmins, the Buddha's lifetime coincided with the 
flourishing of other influential sramana schools of thoughts like Ājīvika, 
Cārvāka, Jain, and Ajñana. 
It was also the age of influential thinkers like Mahāvīra, Pūraṇa Kassapa , 
Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalī, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, 
whose viewpoints the Buddha most certainly
must have been acquainted with and influenced by.[8][9][note 7] Indeed, 
Sariputta and Maudgalyāyana, two of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, 
were formerly the foremost disciples of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, 
the skeptic.[10] There is also evidence to suggest that the two masters, 
Alara Kalama and Udaka Ramaputta, were indeed historical figures
and they most probably taught Buddha two different forms of meditative 
techniques.While the most general outline of "birth, maturity, renunciation, 
search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death"
must be true,[12] most scholars do not consistently accept all of the details 
contained in traditional biographies.[13][14]

The times of Gautama's birth and death are uncertain. Most historians in the 
early 20th century dated his lifetime as circa 563 BCE to 483 BCE.[1][15] 
More recently his death is dated later, between 411 and 400 BCE, while at a 
symposium on this question held in 1988,[16][17][18] the majority of those who 
presented definite opinions gave dates
within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's death.[1][19][note 5] 
These alternative chronologies, however, have not yet been accepted by all 
historians.[20][21][note 8]

The evidence of the early texts suggests that Siddhārtha Gautama was born into 
the Shakya clan, a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and 
culturally, of the northeastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE.[22] 
It was either a small republic, in which case his father was an elected 
chieftain, or an oligarchy, in which case his father was an oligarch.[22] 
According to the Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born in Lumbini, nowadays in 
modern-day Nepal, and raised in Kapilavastu (Shakya capital), which may either 
be in present day Tilaurakot, 
Nepal or Piprahwa, India.[note 1] He obtained his enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, 
gave his first sermon in Sarnath, and died in Kushinagara.

No written records about Gautama have been found from his lifetime or some 
centuries thereafter. One edict of Emperor Ashoka, who reigned from circa 
269 BCE to 232 BCE, commemorates the Emperor's 
pilgrimage to the Buddha's birthplace in Lumbini. Another one of his edicts 
mentions several Dhamma texts, establishing the existence of a written Buddhist tradition at least by the time of the 
Mauryan era and which may be the precursors of the Pāli Canon.[23][note 9] The 
oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, reported 
to have been found in or around 
Haḍḍa near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan and now preserved in the British 
Library. They are written in the Kharoṣṭhī script and the Gāndhārī language on 
twenty-seven birch bark scrolls, and 
they date from the first century BCE to the third century CE.

The Four Noble Truths
Main article: Four Noble Truths

The Buddha teaching the Four Noble Truths. Sanskrit manuscript. Nālandā, Bihar, 
India. The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the 
teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for 
Buddhist thought. 
These four truths explain the nature of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, 
unsatisfactoriness), its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:

The truth of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness[note 5])
The truth of the origin of dukkha
The truth of the cessation of dukkha
The truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha
The first truth explains the nature of dukkha. Dukkha is commonly translated as 
"suffering", "anxiety", "unsatisfactoriness", "unease", etc., and it is said to 
have the following three aspects:

The obvious suffering of physical and mental illness, growing old, and dying.
The anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing.
A subtle dissatisfaction pervading all forms of life due to the fact that all 
forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance. 
On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things 
never measure up to our expectations or standards.[note 6]
The second truth is that the origin of dukkha can be known. Within the context 
of the four noble truths, the origin of dukkha is commonly explained as craving 
(Pali: tanha) conditioned by ignorance (Pali: avijja). 
On a deeper level, the root cause of dukkha is identified as ignorance 
(Pali: avijja) of the true nature of things. 
The third noble truth is that the complete cessation of dukkha is possible, and 
the fourth noble truth identifies a path to this cessation.[note 7]
